# Week #1: 8/24/2020 - Course Tools, R Basics

**Agenda:**   

    --Discuss syllabus
    --Blackboard site
    --Slack
    --Arkansascovid.com
    --Intro R and R Studio. Open program.
    --Read Machlis, Ch. 2
    --Advanced learners, see below
    --Intellectual Property / Data Sharing Releases

**Slack**   

      For the first class, please have Slack installed so we can do some exercises.   
      Please download and activate a Slack account. Do not pay for anything, we'll be using the       free version. 
      https://slack.com/downloads/mac  and log into this channel: datahogs.slack.com
    
**R and R Studio**       
    
    Install R and R Studio.
    
    This is free and open source software. It is not large and doesn't tax the memory a lot. 
    R runs on Windows, Mac and Linux, but this course is designed for the Mac version. 
    If you use Windows, there may be variations in the lessons and instructions. Please see me      for questions.
    
    Installing R is a two-step process: 
    1) Install R, the actual program
    2) Install RStudio, a common interface 

    1) Download the most recent version of R for Mac:         
    https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/bin/macosx/R-4.0.2.pkg

    --If you have a Windows computer, go to: 
    https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/bin/windows/base/R-4.0.2-win.exe

    Accept all of the default settings for Mac.

     2) Install RStudio, the interface we use to manage and create R code. Download the open         source edition of R Studio desktop and follow the prompts to install it.

**Ch 1 & 2 of Machlis: Key Points **  

    Reproducible research 
    Repetitive tasks in modern newsrooms.  Employment reports, crime stats, budgets
    Variables - an R object
    Assignment operator <-
    Case sensitive
    Vector: A vector can only have one type of data - all integers, all strings
    Dataframe - like a spreadsheet
    Save files - Don’t save workspace: because all of your variables will be stored and re-loaded the next time you launch RStudio. It’s too     easy to forget about previously stored variables that can interfere with later work,

    
**Software packages**: tidyverse, rio, pacman

<img src="Images/Popular R libraries.png" width="500" height="250" />

**Software: How to get details and help**

    help(package="dplyr")
    browseVignettes("NameOfPackage”)
    help("NameOfFunction”)
    ??median

![](Images/ImportingDataTip.jpg)



--**Loading and basic file management**

    Bringing in data
    Data Frames
    Extracting interesting details
    Cleaning the data
    Reshaping the format
    Manipulating the data
    Exporting  
    Add a column with a math conversion  


--**Ch 3 & 4 of Machlis: Key Points**

    Ch 3 Exercises:
    Stock chart exercise used quantmod is a library for financial analysis. 
    Median Income for a City
    Loading packages
    
    Ch 4 Importing Data
    How read.table() works for importing data:      
    Loading data
    Manipulating data: dplyr -  stringr
    Data Management: mutate rename bind_rows 


--Math 
--Summary Statistics

  summary(Crime)

  mean(x) Calculate the mean, or average, for variable x.
  median(x) Calculate the median.
  max(x) Find the maximum value.
  min(x) Find the minimum value.
  sum(x) Add all the values together.
  n() Count the number of records. Here there isn’t a variable in the brackets of the function, because the number of records   applies to all variables.
  n_distinct(x) Count the number of unique values in variable x.
  
--Using a function for an equation  
  percent_change <- function(first_number, second_number) {
  pc <- (second_number-first_number)/first_number*100
  return(pc)
}

  percent_change(100,150)
  [1] 50
  
  This is what’s happening in the code above:
  * percent_change is the name of the function, and assigned to it is the function function()
  * Two variables are necessary to be passed to this function, first_number and second_number
  * A new object pc is created using some math calculating percent change from the two variables passed to it
  * the function return() assigns the result of the math to percent_change from the first line
  Build enough functions and you can save them as your own package.

--Set up column for math calculations
  Example: Total column shows winter snowfall in inches. To add a column    showing totals in Meters, you can use this format:   
  .snowdata$Meters <- snowdata$Total * 0.0254
  
--**Export data**    
  Write Export output this file to a CSV or Excel  write.csv or write.excel
  write.csv(AR2016_SMALL,"AR2016_SMALL.csv")

**Questions on First Assignment**   

--Here is a good question that came in today about the first assignment.    

**Question**:     
``"What the hell? I converted population to numeric and the calculations come out as NA values!
This is driving me insane! What is going on?"

**Answer**:   
One of the obnoxious things about R is it considers commas as text. So it will show 720 as a number but 2,810 as not a number for calculations because it has a friggin comma.   

**Never fear.** There is a solution. Run the find and replace function, called gsub   

Crimedata$Population <- gsub(",", "", Crimedata$Population)   

Translation:   
Crimedata$Population   
-- is the population column in your crime dataset     
gsub(",", "",  
finds a comma and replaces it with nothing.  --    
and it found the comma in the column Crimedata$Population)
and the <- dumps the results back into the Crimedata$Population  column.

Fancy!   

**Question**:
"How do I get rid of the last row that only has text in the table that I just imported?"   

**Answer**:
Get rid of row using base R commands   
Crimedata <- Crimedata[-c(187), ]    

Translation:     
Crimedata[-c(187), ]    looks for row #187, which has this garbage text, and gives it the big minus sign, which eliminates it.    
Crimedata <-  dumps this slimmed down table back into your table and so you are good to go.

**Notes**    

    --The pie chart focuses the reader on large percentages, and encourages the reader to think of the total
    --The stacked bar plot provides the same information, but makes it easier to accurately determine at a glance how large each group is out of the whole.
    --This bar chart splits the categories horizontally, and draws attention to how the family members are ordered. It encourages the reader to think about the distribution rather than disconnected categories, and gives a better sense of sense of scale.

    This class is intended to teach you modern workflow techniques for coding. A centerpiece of that workflow is GitHub. This is a website with a system that allows you to collaborate with other programmers on coding projects. It manages versions of software code and is a very popular with the tech elite. 

    Your GitHub account, which is public, represents an important professional image. Prospective employers and collaborators will look at your GitHub account.
