## Wednesday, Oct. 20: Introduction to R

**Agenda**

    Introduction to R
    
**Key Points**

     Reproducible research   
     Repetitive tasks in modern newsrooms.  Employment reports, crime stats, budgets
     Variables - an R object
     Assignment operator <-
     Case sensitive
     Vector: A vector can only have one type of data - all integers, all strings
     Dataframe - like a spreadsheet
     Save files - Don’t save workspace: because all of your variables will be 
     stored and re-loaded the next time you launch RStudio. 
     It’s too easy to forget about previously stored variables that can 
     interfere with later work

**Software packages**: tidyverse, rio, pacman

**Exercises: Basic GitHub**    

    This class is intended to teach you modern workflow techniques for coding. A centerpiece of that workflow is GitHub. This is a website with a system that allows you to collaborate with other programmers on coding projects. It manages versions of software code and is a very popular with the tech elite. 

    Your GitHub account, which is public, represents an important professional image. Prospective employers and collaborators will look at your GitHub account.
    
    Create a GitHub account   
https://github.com/
