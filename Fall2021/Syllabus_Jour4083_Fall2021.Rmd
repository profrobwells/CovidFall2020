**Course Goal:** Students will learn best practices and common software tools to gather, visualize and interpret data effectively in daily journalism. With these skills, they will use data to report for Arkansascovid.com, a statewide news service.

**Course Description:**  The class provides an introduction to the basic data reporting skills, but it is much more than learning software and pressing buttons. This class will describe how to use data to guide and inform your reporting, and how this will change your relationship with sources and the people you cover. At each step, this class describes real-world examples of ethical issues and best practices in data reporting. The end goal is to use data to advance important journalism that helps us tell stories that better serve the public. 


**Cultural Diversity:** This course will advance the broader goal of the School of Journalism and Strategic Media to provide a learning atmosphere that represents a variety of perspectives. Good journalism creates well-rounded, whole pictures that tell stories from multiple points of view. For that reason, this course will examine data sources that describe a diversity of sources and viewpoints, ranging from people of color to people of varying income levels or sexual orientation, and different backgrounds. For example, this class will explore datasets that describe analyze racial disparities in COVID-19 data. 

In the course of this class, students will learn the basic reporting and statistical tools to ask questions about such disparities. We will explore how a major government agency categorizes race, the pitfalls with this data collection problem and consequences for society. We will be speaking with members of local communities, such as the African American and Hispanic communities, as well as local business leaders, about the data we develop and solicit their perspectives on our findings. These activities will permit an exploration of questions about income inequality among gender and racial lines.

The University of Arkansas, nor Dr. Wells, will not tolerate statements, behavior, tokens or insignias that deride or disparage an individual or group because of race, ethnicity, creed or personal lifestyle, when such actions or statements fulfill no educational goal.


This course will report on an evolving news story, the COVID-19 outbreak in Arkansas. We will examine Covid-19 data in Arkansas and produce stories based on this data. We will send out Tweets, stories and produce data visualizations.

Students will learn to create data visualization and receive an introduction to coding in R. Both are powerful tools used in modern news reporting. Quality reporting in newsrooms requires a solid foundation of data analysis.

      A - The work is of professional quality (for journalism "professional" track students) or high academic   quality (for others). It reflects a depth of research, clarity of writing, and a complete grasp of the main concepts presented in the class.    
      B - The work is good but needs editing or is flawed in one of the categories mentioned above.

**COVID-19 Safety:**

The COVID-19 pandemic is in a highly dangerous and somewhat unpredictable phase. Arkansas' hospitals are full with COVID-19 patients, including younger people. Although we cannot require vaccination by Arkansas state law, we know that the more students, faculty, and staff who are vaccinated, the healthier and safer we are as a campus community. Until the community is better protected, it is important that we follow all masking mandates and other important COVID-19 guidelines to protect each other’s health and that of our community. So wear a mask, per university requirements.

Please review the university’s COVID-19 response page, which answers many questions: 

https://health.uark.edu/coronavirus/


**Attendance and Your Health:**

The class is being offered during a pandemic, so I will be flexible in the event health issues prevent your attendance. Please follow two basic rules: 

    1) Do not come to class if you are sick.
    2) If you're absent, tell me what is going on. 
    
In most cases, students will be able to make up work following an illness.

**Class Communications:**  

    1) Teams: This platform, widely used for project management, will be the heart of our communications for         reporting and editing graphics and stories. Students can create their own discussion groups as circumstances     warrant. Breaking news and important documents related to our reporting will be distributed in Teams. Like email, I will expect a timely reply to a direct query to a student on a particular issue. 
    Teams is free through your university Office365 account. Download the Teams App through the Office365 suite 
    https://its.uark.edu/communication-collaboration/office365/office365-desktop-apps.php

    2) Ebook. Instructional content will be delivered via an ebook. 
    
    3) Blackboard: Your graded material will be posted to the course Blackboard site. 
    
    4) UofA email: I will send messages to students via the UofA email accounts about important issues but expect    much of our communication will be in Teams. 

    5) Google Docs / Google Sheets: We will write and edit articles in Google Docs, which permits collaborative      writing and editing. Google Sheets will be used to keep track of important data and for project management. 
    
    
**Expectations for Communications**       
    It is your responsibility to monitor Teams for direct messages and check your UofA email. I respond to email quickly, usually within an hour. I stop responding to student email at 9 p.m.


**Attendance:**  

We will be publishing Arkansascovid.com, so your attendance will be very important. Your colleagues will be relying on you to show up and show up prepared. 

If for some reason you cannot make a class or a publishing assignment, please let me know as soon as possible so I can arrange for a substitute.

**Class Etiquette:**  
Let us all resist the temptation to multitask during class and instead **be present in the brief time we have together.** 


**Academic Honesty:**

**Homework:**

There will be quizzes, memos and homework during the semester worth 35 percent of your grade. These are designed to be lower-stakes assessment to test your proficiency and build your skills for the relevant assignment. The homework and memos flow into the quizzes and they flow into the assignments. The classroom work is iterative and helps students perfect the skills needed for the assignments. 


**Assignments: **
An assignment uploaded late (after 11:59 p.m. on the designated day, according to Blackboard) will be reduced by one grade, and will be reduced a full grade for every subsequent day.

Students with excused absences should contact me immediately about making up missed assignments. The final assignment represents the final examination; there is no separate final examination.

These assignments topics may shift and evolve as we continue our reporting during the semester. I will provide advance notice of any changes.
